# In this project you will define a simple command-line Ruby application that implements a simple Set Calculator. Sets must be implemented as Binary Search Trees (BST). This means that a set is really a BST. Here are the
key features of the project:
# 1. You must maintain up to 3 sets denoted by X, Y and Z. Each of the 3 sets must be printed in ascending order
using an in-order traversal of the corresponding BST.
# 2. All sets hold exclusively numerical values. No duplicate elements are allowed under any circumstances.
# 3. You must implement simple set operations such as union, intersection, deep copying and element insertion
using the BSTs.
# 4. You are not required to keep the BSTs balanced or to delete elements from a set.
# 5. Your program executes a continuous command loop according to the command list below.
Recall that every node n in a BST has two children, subject to the property that the left child holds a value less
than n’s value, and the right child holds a value greater than n’s value. In-order traversal recursively explores nodes
in this order, starting from the root: (1) the left subtree of a node n, (2) node n, and (3) the right subtree of n.
Your submission will be graded according to the following criteria: (1) compliance with this specification, (2)
the presence of code comments, and (3) conciseness (e.g., avoiding definition of unnecessary data structures).
When your project is started, all 3 sets are initially empty. Subsequently, the project will run a command loop
implementing the commands below. Make sure to output the contents of sets X, Y and Z on the console after each
command is executed.
X values — This command takes a comma-separated list of numeric arguments denoted by values. Now sets
X is initialized to the values specified on the command line. The previous content of X is lost.
Y values — This command is similar to command X above, except that it resets the content of set Y.
Z values — This command is similar to command X above, except that it resets the content of set Z.
a i — Numeric argument i is inserted in an appropriate location in set X. The other two sets are not modified.
Of course, insertion must preserve the BST properties of set X.
r — The content of the 3 sets is rotated. Set Y takes the content of X; set Z takes the content of Y; and set X
takes the previous content of Z. The BSTs are not modified or copied in this operation.
s — The contents of sets X and Y are switched. The BSTs are not modified or copied in this operation.
u — This command takes the union of sets X and Y. The result set is stored as X.
i — This command takes the intersection of sets X and Y. The result set is stored as X.
c — Set X is recursively deep copied into set Y. The previous content of Y is lost. After this command is
executed, sets X and Y may not share any data structures.
l aString — This command takes a string argument defining a one-argument lambda experssion. This lambda
is applied to every element of set X. The result of each lambda execution is output on your console. Set X is
not modified. You may assume that the syntax of the lambda in the string is correct.
q — This command quits your project.

Hints. Use method eval() to evaluate a string. For instance the following code creates a lambda from a string
and evaluates the lambda, returning 30:
aString = "-> {a, b = 10, 20 ; c = a + b ;}"
aBlock = eval aString
aBlock.call
